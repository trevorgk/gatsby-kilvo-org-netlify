* If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.
* A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.
* Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.
* For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism.
* He who hesitates is probably right.
* Never do card tricks for the group you play poker with.
* No one is listening until you make a mistake.
* Success always occurs in private, and failure in full view.
* To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many is research.
* Two wrongs are only the beginning.
* Work is accomplished by those employees who are still striving to reach their level of incompetence.
* The sooner you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up. (Project Management at its best).
