Laughter is supposed to be the best medicine.

I was reading in our local newspaper "The Age" a few weeks back about the role humour plays in maintaining morale when times are really tough. I particularly enjoy this so-called "black" or "gallows" humour. A couple of examples from that article:

Q: What did they do for light in Zimbabwe before they had candles?\
A: Electricity.

Q: (From the concentration camps during WWII) What's the difference between a Jewish optimist and a Jewish pessimist?\
A: A Jewish pessimist is living in exile somewhere, a Jewish optimist is here.

I heard on the news (on our winter solstice 21 June 2005) that Cardinal Sin had died and I got to thinking about names and professions and how they reflect one another. For example locally (Melbourne, Australia) we have Nathan Crafti, a member of the legal fraternity. So I did the Google thing and came up with [What's in a Name?](http://www.granoff.net/names) which will amuse those who take a peep.

There is a Doctor Misri practising in Canada who treats depression and who has written a book “Shouldn't I be happy?” Check it out you non-believers, it's true! Feed dr misri to Google.

# []()Calvin - Kids

![cartoon](http://kilvo.org/humour/images/calvin_kids.jpg)

The prompt — I'm sure anyone who's had kids will appreciate this — reminds of something Frank Muir (remember the marvellous BBC show "My Word") once said (to the best of my recollection):

> _Anyone who talks about the pitter-patter of little feet has clearly not had children._
