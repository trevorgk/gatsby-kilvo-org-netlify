* I can only please one person per day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow is not looking good either.
* I love deadlines. I especially like the whooshing sound they make as they go flying by.
* Tell me what you need, and I'll tell you how to get along without it.
* Accept that some days you are the pigeon and some days the statue.
* Needing someone is like needing a parachute. If he isn't there the first time, chances are you won't be needing him again.
* I don't have an attitude problem, you have a perception problem.
* Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky, and I thought to myself, "where the heck is the ceiling?"
* My reality cheque bounced.
* On the keyboard of life, always keep one finger on the escape key.
* I don't suffer from stress. I am a carrier.
* You are slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter.
* Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons, because you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
* Everybody is somebody else's weirdo.
* Never argue with idiots. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
* A pat on the back is only a few inches from a kick in the butt.
* Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.
* After any salary raise, you will have less money at the end of the month than you did before.
* The more crap you put up with, the more crap you are going to get.
* You can go anywhere you want if you look serious and carry a clipboard.
* Eat one live toad the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.
* If it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done.
* When you don't know what to do, walk fast and look worried.
* Following the rules will not get the job done.
* When confronted by a difficult problem, you can solve it more easily By reducing it to the question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?"
* Only the mediocre are at their best all the time.
* There's a fine line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line.
* Bring ideas in and entertain them royally, for one of them may be the king.
* If at first you don't succeed......skydiving isn't for you.
* Life is a waste of time; time is a waste of life, so get wasted all of the time and have the time of your life.
* When everything is coming your way ...... you're in the wrong lane!
