title: Brewster the Rooster
---
A farmer was in the fertilized egg business. He had several hundred young hens or pullets and eight or ten roosters, whose job was to fertilize the eggs.

He kept records and any rooster that didn't perform went into the soup pot and was replaced. But keeping track of rooster performance took a lot of the farmer's time so he got a set of tiny bells and attached them to his roosters. Each bell had a different tone and this allowed the farmer, from a distance, to know which rooster was performing - simply by listening to the bells.

One particular morning the farmer noticed that the bell of his favourite rooster, Brewster, hadn't rung at all, so he went to investigate.

The other roosters were chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing. The pullets, hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.

BUT, to the farmer's amazement, Brewster had his bell in his beak, so it wouldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one!

The farmer was so proud of Brewster, he entered him in the county fair ... and Brewster became an overnight sensation among the judges. They not only gave Brewster the “No Bell Piece Prize” but they also awarded him the “Pulletsurprise” as well.

Clearly Brewster was a politician. Who else could figure out how to win two of the most politically biased awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the populace and screwing them?
