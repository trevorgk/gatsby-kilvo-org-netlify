title: A Psychologist's Dictionary
---


> I found this in a little booklet titled “A Psychologist's Dictionary — defining scientific and technical terms chosen for their usefulness to those members of the learned professions who practise forensically.” My copy was the second edition 1980 revised and enlarged copyright © 1980 Maurice Whitta and Associates.
>
> Maurice Whitta and Associates were a firm of Psychologists whose office was in St Kilda Road, Melbourne. I can no longer track them, to see whether they object to me using their copyrighted material. Given that they are not a firm of lawyers I took the liberty. In any one knows how to contact Mr Whitta I would be pleased to hear from them.

  A wholly objective account of the writer's own life. as “I Am Joe's Adrenal Gland”.
