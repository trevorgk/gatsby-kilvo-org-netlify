title: Plum Cake
blurb: "*Recipe from Barbara Sonand.*"
category: Cakes and Desserts
recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 250 gms unsalted butter
      - 250 gms sugar
      - 4 eggs
      - 200 gms self-raising flour
      - 50 gms almond meal
      - About 8 blood plums, washed
      - A teaspoon of vanilla essence
    method: >-
      Pre-heat the oven to about 190°C. Butter a lasagne container, a roasting
      pan or something of that ilk. Mine is about 35 x 25 x5 cms.


      Sift together the flour and almond meal to eliminate any lumps.


      Cream the butter and sugar in an electric mixer until white and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, and the vanilla. Fold in the flour and meal mixture, and pour (maybe scrape is closer) the mixture into the pan.


      If the plums are smallish halve them, otherwise cut them slightly smaller, getting rid of the stone. Place them on top of our batter, (optionally) sprinkle with a little extra sugar, and bake for about 45 minutes. Test with a skewer.


      This makes a great cake which keeps well. Of course if it is hot it makes a terrific dessert with good cream and/or vanilla ice-cream. I'm an “and” man myself.
