title: Nam Jim Classic Thai Dressing
blurb: >-
  *This comes from Brigitte Hafner in Melbourne's “The Age” Epicure Section

  > “I love this classic Thai dressing that is hot and sour and tangy all at once. It is excellent over any grilled meat or fish, or tossed in salads with some fresh herbs such as mint or coriander. In this recipe I've used beef, but you could make this salad with barbecued chicken, prawns, calamari or even Chinese barbecued pork. Use the recipe more as a guide, adjusting the amounts of fish sauce, sugar and lime juice to taste. Many Thai recipes omit the garlic, ginger and coriander root but I like the oomph and flavour they give. If you don't want it too hot, remove the seeds from the chillies before crushing.”

  - recipeTitle: Salad
    ingredients:
      - 600 gms beef such as eye fillet, porterhouse or rump
      - half a packet of rice vermicelli noodles
      - a few handfuls of fresh chopped herbs such as mint, coriander and

      Roughly chop the chillies, garlic and ginger. Place them in a mortar and
      pestle or blender with the coriander and crush until you have a rough
      paste. Add the sugar and continue blending until the sugar is dissolved.
