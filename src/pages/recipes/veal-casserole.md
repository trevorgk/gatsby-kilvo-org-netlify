title: Veal Casserole
blurb: This is from my friend Bernadine ("Frankie") Kennedy who regularly cooked
  it at the Albert Park Deli. The origin is lost in the mists of time. This
  makes a lot so you may wish to scale it. Serve it with Garlic Mash.

  - ingredients:
      - 4 kg diced veal
    method: >-
      Coat veal in the seasoned flour. Heat a generous splash of olive oil in a
      large casserole dish and saute the onions, garlic and capsicum until
      softened. Add the chopped anchovies and mush them around until they
      dissolve. Remove from pot.


      Add further splashes of oil and cook the veal in batches until golden brown (don't overcrowd the pot).


      Deglaze the pot with the wine and marsala. Stir well and reduce by half.


      Add the stock, bay leaves and juniper berries and bring to the boil. Chuck in the oregano. Return the meat and vegetables along with any juices to the pot and allow the return to a gentle boil. Season with pepper - the anchovies should provide sufficient salt.


      Cover with a lid and cook over low heat for 1 - 1Â½ hours or until tender, stirring frequently.
