    method: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C


      Cream butter & sugar (Al says she melts butter first --- it is quicker and seems to work the same)


      Add vanilla essence and egg --- mix well. Mix together flour and cocoa, add to mixture with chocolate.


      Teaspoonfuls onto baking tray, bake for 15-20 minutes


      We usually make a double quantity as they do not last long.
