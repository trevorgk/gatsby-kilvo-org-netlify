blurb: >-
  *I was given this by Simon Hinge:*


  > “It doesn't really matter what sort of tomatoes you use. You can mix them up, but it is best if they are really ripe. You need to start the process the day before, and you will need a very large pot.”
category: Sauces, Dressings & Preserves
recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 5½ kgs (12 lbs) of ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped
    method: >-
      Roughly chop the tomatoes and garlic, place in the pot and add the salt.
      Stir well and leave overnight (to “fester”).


      The next day add the sugar, vinegar and all the spices tied in a muslim bag.


      Bring to the boil and simmer for about 3½ hours. Keep stirring to stop it sticking to the bottom. Use common sense to assess the degree of thickening.


      Now you need to tidy it up, so start by getting rid of the spice bag.


      Working in batches pass the sauce through a moulinex (a hand cranked gadget for puréeing vegetables). This will get rid of the tomato skins and seeds. Alternatively you could try using a fine colander and then use a blender. The aim is a smooth sauce.


      Pour into sterilized bottles, and remember your mates.
