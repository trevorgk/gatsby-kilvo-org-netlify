blurb: "*Also from Barbara Sonand.*"
category: Cakes and Desserts
recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 250 gms soft Cottage cheese
      - 250 gms plain flour
      - 250 gms unsalted butter
      - 8 Granny Smith Apples
      - Sultanas (optional)
      - " Cinnamon"
      - 4-6 tablespoons of sugar
    method: >-
      Peel and slice the apples, and stew with a tiny amount of water to start
      the process, and add sugar depending on how sour the apples are. Add a
      teaspoon of cinnamon at the end, and the sultanas if using, and and stir
      through. Set aside.


      Chop the butter and combine with the cheese and flour in a bowl. Make a pastry by mixing with your hands until smooth, wrap in plastic and chill in the freezer (this dough can be made the day before and frozen overnight, and thawed out when the apples are being prepared). Roll out into a square with the thickness of about 2mm. Divide into about 40 little squares.


      Assemble the individual cakes by sharing out the stewed fruit between the squares. Fold the corners up to make little octagons, and bake in 200Â°C oven for about twenty minutes (judge by the colour you like, but at least "golden").
