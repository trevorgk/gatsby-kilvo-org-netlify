  - ingredients:
      - 1 Kg long grained rice
      - " 600 gms small mushrooms"
      - 4 smallish to medium carrots, grated
      - 4 onions, finely chopped
      - 6 Maggi chicken stock cubes
      - Salt & pepper to taste
    method: >-
      Cook rice in 6 litres of boiling salted water containing the stock cubes
      until al dente. Add dried mushrooms to the water if you have some (to
      improve the flavour). Dry rice in colander.


      Fry onions till golden in a tablespoon of butter. Ditto with carrots (separately) till "dry", say 15 minutes. Slice mushrooms thinly and also fry with butter till dry (use a little rice to clean each frying stage).


      When ready to serve mix together and heat in 200°C oven for ¾ of an hour.


      This is a bit fiddly to make but is absolutely sensational.
