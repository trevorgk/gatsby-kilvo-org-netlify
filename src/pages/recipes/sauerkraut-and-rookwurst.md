    ingredients:
      - 1 kg potatoes, peeled and quartered
      - 500 gms sauerkraut
      - 6 peppercorns
      - 6 Juniper berries
      - 250 gms kaiserfleisch
    method: >-
      In a large saucepan add enough water to just cover the potatoes and add
      salt. Add the sauerkraut separated) and scatter the spices on top. Sit the
      rookwurst on top and cook the potatoes.

      While the potatoes are cooking, dice the kaiserfleisch and cook over a low heat until it is crisp and crunchy.

      When cooked, drain the potatoes and keep the sausage warm. Remove the spices (easier said than done!) and mash the potatoes and cabbage. Stir through the bacon pieces and the fat, and serve with a chunk of sausage, some mustard, and green peas.
