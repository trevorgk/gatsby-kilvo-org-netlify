  somewhere and can't remember, and thus acknowledge, the source. I have
  rescaled it into metric._

recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 1 Kg raspberries (I use frozen ones)
      - 635 ml white wine vinegar
      - Sugar according to taste (see below)
    method: >-
      Put the raspberries into a wide-mouthed jar and crush them lightly with
      the back of a wooden spoon. Cover with the vinegar.


      Tightly cover and leave for a week or two, shaking occasionally.


      Strain through muslin or something similar (I use a clean tea towel), squeezing out as much juice as possible.


      Measure the juice and transfer to a pan.


      Add 200-500 gms of sugar per litre of juice extracted, according to taste.


      Heat gently, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and then bring to the boil.


      Boil for ten minutes and pour into hot sterilised bottles and seal.


      Note: You may omit the sugar if you want but the vinegar still needs to be boiled.
