title: Banana Cake
blurb: '*This is from a book called "Australian Cuisine" by Maureen Simpson,
  published by ABC Enterprises for the Australian Broadcasting Commission*'
category: Cakes and Desserts
recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 125 gms Butter
      - ¾ cup caster sugar (I use less, ½ cup)
      - 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
      - 2 eggs
      - 2 ripe bananas
      - "1½ cups self-raising flour "
      - ¼ level teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
      - ¼ cup milk
    method: >-
      Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one
      at a time and beat well. Mash bananas well with a fork (my last ones were
      so old and black on the outside this really wasn't necessary!), then beat
      into the creamed mixture.


      Fold in sifted flour and soda, then stir in milk. Place evenly into a well-greased 20cm (8 inch) ring tin.


      Bake in a moderate oven (180°C) for about 45 minutes. Remove from oven, cool for a few minutes and then turn out onto a cake cooler.


      Serve sliced with whipped cream or ice with vanilla frosting (I prefer Cream Cheese Icing).


      Adding a handful of raisins is good.
