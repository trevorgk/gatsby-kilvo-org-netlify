  - recipeTitle: 6 small flathead fillets
    ingredients:
      - 6 small flathead fillets
      - 1/2 cup self-raising flour
      - 1/2 cup cornflour
      - 1/2 cup carbonated mineral water
      - 250 ml vegetable oil
    method: >-
      Cut flathead fillets in half lengthways.


      Mix flours in a medium bowl. Add mineral water and mix well. Place fish fillets in the batter and coat well.


      Place oil in a 22cm frypan over moderate heat. If your pan is larger add more oil - we want about 1 cm depth. Test the oil by dropping a little batter into the pan: it will sizzle when the oil is hot.


      Pick up a fillet with a fork and drain excess batter into the bowl, then carefully lay the fish in the pan.


      Repeat, cooking a few at a time for 2-3 minutes a side until lightly golden. Drain on paper towels.


      Serve with shoestring chips and salad.
