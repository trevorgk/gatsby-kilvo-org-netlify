  I found this on the Web (Sydney Morning
  Herald)[http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/cuisine/meat/recipe/cevapcici-sausages-20111021-1mbte.html].
  Here is Bill Granger's introduction:  


  > Everyone has their favourite ready-made sausages, but for something a bit different, try this Balkan classic. If you like things hot, amp up the spice.

      - 500g beef mince
    method: >-
      Place all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.


      Line a biscuit tray with baking paper. Place meat mixture on tray, flatten it to about 2cm thick, place another sheet of baking paper on top, and place a chopping board of about the same size as the tray on top to press it down.


      Flip tray, remove tray and top layer of baking paper, and cut meat patty into small rectangles, about 7cm x 2cm. Leave them on baking paper and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until firm or ready to cook.


      Separate cevapcici and shape into little sausages.


      Preheat barbecue to hot. Barbecue cevapcici, turning minimally, for about 10 minutes or until browned and cooked through. Serve with parsley and white onion salad.
