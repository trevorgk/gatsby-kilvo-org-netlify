blurb: >-
  _This is from Italy The Beautiful Cookbook, Authentic Recipes from the Regions
  of Italy, by Lorenza de´ Medici, 1988. In Italian the recipe is called Fegato
  Di Vitello Alla Veneziana._


  To quote the author:

  > It is essential for the success of this famous dish that the liver be tender and that it be cooked very briefly over very high heat, so that it doesn't become hard and dry. It is best to cook the onions separately and to add them at the last moment.

      Slice the liver very thinly and cut into medium pieces. Say about 1cm x

      over low heat. Remove onions and keep warm.

      Melt the rest of the butter in the skillet, add the liver and sauté over high heat until just cooked through. Add salt to taste, then mix in the onions. Serve immediately, garnished with chopped flat-leaf parsley if desired.
