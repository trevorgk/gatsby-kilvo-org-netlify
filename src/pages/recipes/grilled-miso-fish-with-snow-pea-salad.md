title: Grilled Miso fish with snow pea salad
blurb: >-
  This is from an article by Jill Dupleix in the ABC's "delicious" magazine,
  October 2008. Jill says her recipe is based on Nobu Matsuhisa's, but her
  adaptation is lighter and simpler.


  By the way, "delicious" is a fantastic magazine published by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I have had them all, except three early issues — would any reader without a subscription who has one or more of them please return them?

      - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - recipeTitle: Snow pea salad
    ingredients:
      - 200g snow peas, thinly sliced on an angle
    method: >-
      Place soy, mirin and sugar in a small pan and bring to the boil over
      medium-high heat. Add miso and whisk until smooth. Remove from heat,
      transfer to a shallow bowl and cool completely


      When cool, add the fish and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for at leat two hours or overnight.


      Heat a grill to high. Line a wire rack with foil. Place fish on the rack, discarding marinade, and grill for 5 minutes or until golden and caramelised (cooking the fish on the rack like this brings it closer to the grill and allows the heat to circulate — only turn if it starts to burn).


      Meanwhile toss the salad ingredients together in a bowl, then season.


      Divide salad and noodle between plates or bowls, then served topped with fish.
