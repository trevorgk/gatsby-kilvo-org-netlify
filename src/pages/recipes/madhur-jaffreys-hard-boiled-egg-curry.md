      Combine the cayenne, turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, lemon
      juice, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Mix.


      Put the oil in a medium-sized, non stick frying pan and set over medium heat.


      When oil is hot, put in the cumin seeds. Ten seconds later, put in the onion and ginger. Put in the spice paste.


      Stir and cook for 15 seconds. Now put in the tomatoes and sugar. Bring to simmer.


      Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Put in the cilantro.


      Stir once or twice. Lay the cut eggs in the sauce and spoon more sauce over them.


      Cover and gently simmer for 2-3 minutes. And then serve with rice or even bread (toasted or plain).
