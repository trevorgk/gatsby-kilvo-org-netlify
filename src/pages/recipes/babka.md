blurb: >-
  *Recipe from Barbara Sonand. I think “Babka” is Polish for “Grandmother”, so
  this is Grandmother's Cake.*


  This needs a special cake tin with a hollow centre and flutings on the outside. I will try to find out it's technical name — Poles of course refer to it as a Babka tin. I'm not sure if I can call mine a tin anymore, as it is made from silicone, but it is super!


  **NB** it is called a fluted ring cake pan TGK
