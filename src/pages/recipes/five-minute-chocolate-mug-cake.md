recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 4 tablespoons flour
      - 4 tablespoons sugar
      - 2 tablespoons cocoa
      - 3 tablespoons chocolate chips (optional)
      - 1 egg
      - 3 tablespoons milk
      - 3 tablespoons oil
      - Small splash of vanilla extract
    method: >-
      You will need a very large coffee mug (I used one of those giant European
      tea cups).


      Add flour, sugar and cocoa to mug and mix well.


      Add the egg and mix thoroughly. Pour in the milk and oil and mix well.


      Add the chocolate chips (if using), and the vanilla extract and mix well.


      Put the mug in the microwave and cook for 3 minutes at 1000 watts (High on my nuker).


      The cake will rise over the top of the mug but don't panic. Allow to cool a little, then tip out onto a plate (if you wish to share or add ice-cream).


      There is enough for two people.
