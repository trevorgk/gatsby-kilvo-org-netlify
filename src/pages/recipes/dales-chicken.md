blurb: This recipe was sent to me by Jan van Riel, who apparently has the usual
  problem of an inadequate filing system for recipes. She says that putting it
  here will enable her to find it when she wants it, and also enable a better
  way to pass it on.

    ingredients:
      - '#20 chicken, flat/butterflied, de-boned, with wing tips removed and
        drumsticks boned out if possible. If you want to stretch it further,
        also get 1-2 chicken breasts.'
      - 4 thick slices of ham
      - 5 eggs
      - Spinach
      - Swiss style cheese (optional)
    method: >-
      Preheat fan-forced oven to 200 degrees centigrade.


      Lay chicken out flat with skin down. If you have extra chicken breast(s), lie it on top of an un-meaty part of the chicken. You can even stuff the cavities of the drumsticks with extra chicken if you like.


      Place the ham slices on top of the open chicken.


      Make an omelette (under cook rather than overcook it) and place that on top of the ham.


      Cook some chopped spinach in the microwave, squeeze out the water and sprinkle it over the omelette. You can place some thinly sliced cheese on top of the spinach. Season it with salt and pepper.


      Roll the chicken so that the edges overlap. If you have stuffed it very full (with extra breasts or an omelette made with extra eggs), use bamboo skewers and string to hold the chicken together. Don’t worry about make it pretty – it’s a rough affair.


      Par-cook the chicken in a covered dish in the microwave for about 10 minutes. Then season the outside of the chicken with salt and pepper and pop it in the oven for about 30 minutes, more if you’ve put extra filling in. It may take longer so test it with a skewer where the drumstick joins the body – it stays very moist. Let it sit a while before you serve it.
