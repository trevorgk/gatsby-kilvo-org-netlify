      Wash the spinach well after removing stalks, and drain.


      Either heat the olive oil in a wide saucepan or deep frying pan, and cook the spinach on a high heat for a few minutes, tossing all the time, or zap in microwave on high for ten minutes


      Place in colander and when cool squeeze out as much moisture as you can.


      Chop and season, and place on the bottom of a lightly greased shallow casserole.


      Quarter the hard-boiled eggs and place over the top, pressing them gently into the bed of spinach.


      Melt the butter to make the sauce, add the flour and fry until pale golden, tip in the milk warming it in the microwave first helps) in stages stirring all the time. Cook for about three minutes and then mix in the tin of salmon including the juice. Stir well and pour this over the top of the spinach/eggs.


      Put the mixture of crumbs/cheese over the top and bake when ready. It should be heated through and the top golden. Say 200 degrees. Serve with toast fingers or rice.
