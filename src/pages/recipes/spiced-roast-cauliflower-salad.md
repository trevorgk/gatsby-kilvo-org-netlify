  # Spiced Roast Cauliflower Salad


  I dined at Cumulus Inc recently and the Cauliflower salad was wonderful. I went looking for the recipe and came across this (see [Nibbledish](http://www.nibbledish.com/people/Chengaleng/recipes/spiced-roast-cauliflower-salad "Nibbledish")). To quote Nibbledish:


  *This was inspired by the cauliflower salad at Melbourne restaurant Cumulus Inc. and the Jamie Oliver roast cauliflower recipe. I loved the grainy yet tender texture of the chickpea-sized cauliflower bits. The natural sweetness is intensified by roasting.*
