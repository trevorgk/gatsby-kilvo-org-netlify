  *This is another of Nana's recipes.*


  *Unfortunately Tiger Cheese is no longer available in Australia. You can use Gruyere instead (which is after all what the Tiger triangles were made from).*

recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 6 zucchinis (courgettes)
      - 1 egg yolk
      - ½ cup milk
      - 250 ml Cream
      - 2 Grated Tiger Cheese triangles
    method: >-
      Par boil the zucchinis - start with cold water and take out as soon as
      they reach the boil.


      Cut them into cylinders about 4 cms tall (1 ½ inches) and arrange them on their ends in a suitably sized baking dish. We want the dish to be full.


      Grate the cheese and mix with the whisked egg yolk, milk and cream. Season with salt and pepper.




      Pour over the zucchinis, and bake for about ½ an hour at 200° Celcius.
