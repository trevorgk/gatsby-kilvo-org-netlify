      - 5 litres pure cream
      - 450 grams sugar
      - tiny pinch salt
      - 3 vanilla beans
      - 1 teaspoon vanilla concentrate
      - half cup brandy
    method: >-
      Bring the cream to the boil with the vanilla beans. Mix the rest of the
      ingredients together.


      When cream boils add to the rest of the ingredients, whisking all the time. Cook for 3 minutes while continuing to whisk. Remove from heat and keep whisking as it cools.


      Let cool, split the vanilla beans and scrape into mixture, rewhisk.


      Pour into separate dishes and let cool. A sugary skin should form, which should be blow-torched when ready to serve.
