title: Onion marmalade
blurb: This recipe originally came from "The Age" Epicure section probably in
  August 2008 (I lost the article, at least for the moment, so cannot properly
  acknowledge the source). Neil Ewart made it, and it was sensational. Here is
  what he gave me from memory.
category: Sauces, Dressings & Preserves
recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 1kg brown onions, sliced
      - 1kg sugar
      - 75g mustard seeds
      - 300ml sweet chilli sauce
      - 400ml red wine vinegar
    method: >-
      Saute the onions in a little olive oil to soften.

      Add the sugar and let dissolve. Add the remaining ingredients and boil until the right consistency†.

      Take off heat and spoon into hot, sterilised jars. Seal.

      † Not quite the same ruthless precision he displays at the Bridge table.
