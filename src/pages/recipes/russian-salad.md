title: Russian Salad
blurb: Also from Barbara Sonand.
category: Side Dishes
recipes:
  - ingredients:
      - 5 medium size potatoes
      - 3 medium size carrots, (peeled)
      - 1 440 gm tin of Golden Circle Green Peas
      - 5 Hard boiled eggs
      - 5 Sweet and Sour cucumbers
      - Mayonnaise (Praise is good)
      - Salt and pepper to taste (a lot)
    method: >-
      Cook the potatoes and the carrots whole. When cool enough to handle, peel
      the potatoes and chop everything into bits about the size a cubic
      centimetre (fairly small). Mix everything well together - a large mixing
      bowl helps.


      This is my Polish mother-in-law's recipe (Barbara Sonand). My friend Henry Goldberg says it isn't Russian Salad because it lacks both onion and beetroot. And he hates me using tinned peas! Maybe it's really Polish Salad. It's all very confusing. Whatever it should be called, it's delicious.
