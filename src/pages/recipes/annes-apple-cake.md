      Separate eggs and beat the whites until stiff. Cream together the yolks

      Fold the egg whites into creamed mixture.


      Grease a large circular cake tin (mine is 28 cm diameter and 10 cm high) and dust with bread crumbs. Pour the batter into tin and set the apple halves on top flat side up. Sprinkle with lemon juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, raisins and blobs of jam.


      Bake in 150°C oven (300°F) for 1¾-2 hours. The cake will have started to come away from the edge of the tin.
