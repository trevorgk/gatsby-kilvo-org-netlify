title: Braised Red Cabbage
blurb: >-
  *I got this from Neil Perry's book "The Food I Love, Beautiful, Simple Food to
  Cook at Home" published by Murdoch Books in 2005. It is very similar to the
  recipe used by Barbara Sonand, which I do from memory, so better to provide a
  "proper" recipe.*


  I always make double this quantity, as it keeps and reheats well, and is very popular (even among people who claim not to like cabbage).

      Roughly slice the cabbage. Heat the oil in a deep saucepan and sweat the
      onion, garlic and salt over low heat for a few minutes until soft. Add the
      cabbage and continue to cook slowly for 5-7 minutes, or until it is
      completely soft.


      Add the apple, vinegar and sugar and cook for a further 3 minutes, then add the wine and leave to simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the stock, cover and simmer for a further hour.
    ingredients:
      - Â½ small red cabbage, outer leaves removed
